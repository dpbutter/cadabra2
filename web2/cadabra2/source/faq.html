<h2>Installation</h2>

  <input type="radio" name="collapse" id="q_01_01">    
  <h3 class="handle">
    <label for="q_01_01">The Jupyter kernel does not start.</label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      In order for Jupyter to start the Cadabra kernel, it has to be
      able to find the <tt>cadabra2</tt> and <tt>cadabra2_jupyter</tt>
      modules. If you are using a binary package, these things will be
      installed in a path searched by the system python, but if you
      built from source, they may not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, if you configure with <tt>cmake ..</tt> with no
      further options, the installation will be into
      <tt>/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages</tt> (possibly with a
      different python version number). You need to add this to
      your <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>, e.g. using
      <div class='verbatim'>
        <div class="source donthyphenate">
          <pre class='output'>export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      in the terminal, before starting <tt>jupyter notebook</tt> from
      there. You can stick this into the <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> file to
      make it automatic at every terminal start.
    </p>

    <label for="q_01_02">I get a 'Generic LaTeX error' when evaluating a cell.</label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This is typically caused by a missing LaTeX package. The error
      dialog may give you a hint, but if you want to see the full
      LaTeX error, take note of the file name in the error dialog, and
      try to run that file through <tt>latex</tt> by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common missing package is <tt>ytableau</tt>, which you
      can get on Debian/Ubuntu systems by installing
      the <tt>texlive-science</tt> package (or on older versions,
      the <tt>texlive-math-extra</tt> package) and on Fedora by
      installing <tt>texlive-ytableau</tt>.

<h2>How to...</h2>

<div class='faq_item'>
  <input type="radio" name="collapse" id="q_02_01">    
  <h3 class="handle">
    <label for="q_02_01">What is the difference between free, fixed
    and independent indices?</label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    When you declare an index set, you can give it a <tt>position</tt>
    property, which takes one of three
    values <tt>free</tt>, <tt>fixed</tt>
    or <tt>independent</tt>. Indices which are <tt>free</tt> can be
    raised or lowered at will, and pairs can be at the same position;
    these are typically used in case there is no metric associated to
    them. Indices which have a different meaning when they are in
    subscript or superscript position should, instead, be
    declared <tt>fixed</tt>; this is what you would typically do in
    special/general relativity, where the difference between an upper
    or lower index is a factor of the metric. Cadabra can still swap
    the position of pairs of indices in e.g. the <tt>canonicalise</tt>
    function. If you want Cadabra to never touch the position of
    indices in a set, declare them <tt>independent</tt>.

  <input type="radio" name="collapse" id="q_02_02">    
  <h3 class="handle">
    <label for="q_02_02">How can I select all terms which contain a particular symbol?</label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    Consider an expression like
    <div class='verbatim'>
      <div class="source donthyphenate">
        <pre class='output'>ex:= A + A B + A B C + B C + D E;</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    There are two ways to use <tt>zoom</tt> to select terms which
    contain <tt>A</tt>. One will select terms which <strong>only</strong>
    contain the factor <tt>A</tt>,
    <div class='verbatim'>
      <div class="source donthyphenate">
        <pre class='output'>zoom(ex, $A$);
	</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    The other one selects all terms which have <tt>A</tt> <strong>as
    well as</strong> other factors,
    <div class='verbatim'>
      <div class="source donthyphenate">
        <pre class='output'>zoom(ex, $A B??$);
	</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    You can combine these two to select all terms which contain either
    a bare <tt>A</tt> or <tt>A</tt> multiplied with other things,
    <div class='verbatim'>
      <div class="source donthyphenate">
        <pre class='output'>zoom(ex, $A, A B??$);
	</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Error messages</h2>

<div class='faq_item'>
  <input type="radio" name="collapse" id="q_04_01">    
  <h3 class="handle">
    <label for="q_04_01">RuntimeError: Dependencies on derivatives
    are not yet handled in the sympy bridge.</label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    This error occurs when you try to use the <tt>evaluate</tt>
    algorithm on an expression with derivatives, and the expression
    contains objects which were declared with a
    property <tt>::Depends(\partial{&#35;})</tt> or something to that
    extent.

    To avoid the issue, there are two ways out. Either declare the
    dependence of that object directly on the coordinate. So instead
    do something like
    <div class='verbatim'>
      <div class="source donthyphenate">
        <pre class='output'>x::Coordinate;
A::Depends(x);</pre></div></div>
    The other alternative is to simply switch off automatic
    simplification, by using the <tt>simplify=False</tt> argument to
    the <tt>evaluate</tt> function.

<h2>Design and philosophy</h2>


<div class='faq_item'>
  <input type="radio" name="collapse" id="q_03_01">    
  <h3 class="handle">
    <label for="q_03_01">Why not build the tensor functionality into
      Sympy, and wedge into Sympy's expression parser?
    </label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    Cadabra uses the philosophy that expressions should be represented
    in their own language, not Python. However, one can do something
    like that in Sympy, by only feeding expressions in string form to
    the logic in <code>sympy.parsing.sympy_parser</code>. So in a
    sense Sympy supports this Cadabraesque mode of working, even
    though the tutorials and examples do not emphasise it.

    The reason why Cadabra nevertheless uses its own parser, and its
    own tree representation of expressions, is simply that an enormous
    amount of work would have to be done to rewrite the lot so that it
    fits into the Sympy framework. Moreover, little would be gained by
    doing this: almost all functionality which is in Sympy and which
    would make sense when applied to tensors (think of taking
    derivatives, or pattern matching) would require a lot of extra
    Sympy code to extend it beyond scalars.

    The way things are now the separation is clean, localised, and
    relatively easy to maintain. If you would ever rewrite
    Cadabra+Sympy from scratch you might take a different approach,
    but that's not going to happen soon.

  <input type="radio" name="collapse" id="q_03_02" >    
  <h3 class="handle">
    <label for="q_03_02">Why an independent notebook interface instead of building on
      IPython?</label>
  </h3>
  <div class="content">
    There are a number of reasons for this. For starters, Cadabra's
      notebook interface predates IPython (that is, a publically
      available version of it) by quite a few years. That by itself is
      of course not a very good reason to keep developing the Cadabra
      notebook interface, but it does play a certain role.

    <p>A more important reason has to do with the fact that there are,
      despite what one might think at first inspection, quite a few
      differences between IPython/Jupyter and the Cadabra interface. The
      most obvious one is that Cadabra is a native application, which
      does not rely on a web browser to display its results. I still
      think that native applications have their place, as they tend to
      look and feel much better than web apps.</p>

    <p>IPython/Jupyter tend to be focussed a lot on data-centric
      problems, and less so on being a nice front-end for symbolic
      mathematics. These two do differ.</p>

    <p>Another reason to keep developing the Cadabra notebook
      interface is that it allows me much more flexibility in trying new
      features and ideas.
