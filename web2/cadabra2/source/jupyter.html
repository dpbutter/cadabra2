<h1>Cadabra in Jupyter</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
  By virtue of the Cadabra kernel for Jupyter, it is possible to use
  Cadabra from a Jupyter notebook. This allows you to use Cadabra
  notation in a familiar environment, and make use of
  e.g.&nbsp;Jupyter widgets for visualisation, or other things which
  are currently not possible in the Cadabra notebook interface.
</p>

  </div>
<p class="hyphenate">
  The Cadabra Cloud service makes use of Jupyter to provide you with
  an on-line service to run Cadabra; send an email
  to <a href="mailto:cloud@cadabra.science?Subject=Cadabra%20Cloud%20access&Body=I%20would%20like%20to%20register%20for%20beta%20access%20to%20Cadabra%20Cloud.">cloud@cadabra.science</a>
  if you want to get access.
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
  If you do a standard build from source, or if you obtained Cadabra
  from a binary package (at least version 2.3.1.15), you will get the
  Cadabra Jupyter kernel automatically. You should be able to start
  the Jupyter notebook as usual with
</p>
<div class="output">  jupyter notebook</div>
<p class="hyphenate">
  The 'New' button in the top-right of the screen should then give you
  the option of creating a new notebook with a 'Cadabra2' kernel. If
  that fails, and the error messages produced by Jupyter indicate that
  it cannot find the Cadabra kernel, you may need
  to <a href="faq.html#q_01_01">adjust your <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt></a>.
</p>

<h2>Docker version</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
  Alternatively, you can use
  the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kpeeters/cadabra2-jupyter">official
  Docker image for Cadabra</a>, available from DockerHub, which
  contains a Jupyter server with the Cadabra kernel. This will not be
  able to see existing Python package installations on your system,
  but has the advantage of being easy to install (and easy to remove,
  if you ever want to do that).
</p>

  <!--<h2>Old Xeus-based kernel</h2>
<p>
  To obtain the Cadabra kernel for Jupyter, you need to either install
  it from Anaconda,
  or <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2/JUPYTER.rst">build
  it yourself</a>. To install, ensure that the required channel is
  active, and update/install:
</p>
<div class="output">  conda config --add channels conda-forge
  conda update --all
  conda install cadabra2-jupyter-kernel</div>
<p>
  If the above went well, you should now be able to start the Jupyter
  notebook as usual with
</p>
<div class="output">  jupyter notebook</div>
<p>
  The 'New' button in the top-right of the screen should then give you
  the option of creating a new notebook with a Cadabra kernel.
</p>-->

<h2>Differences with Cadabra's own notebook</h2>
<p class="hyphenate">
  When you use Cadabra within Jupyter, most things will work as in
  Cadabra's own notebook interface. The main thing to keep in mind is
  that Jupyter notebooks (with extension <tt>.ipynb</tt>) and Cadabra
  notebooks (with extension <tt>.cnb</tt>) are not the same file
  format. You can read notebooks created in Jupyter into the Cadabra
  <tt>cadabra2-gtk</tt> client, and you can (as of version 2.3.3)
  export Cadabra notebooks as Jupyter notebooks (or convert them using
  the <tt>cadabra2ipynb</tt> command-line utility), but it is good to
  keep this in mind.
</p>
<p class="hyphenate">
  You <em>can</em>, however, make use of Cadabra packages inside the
  Jupyter notebook, so you can still do <tt>import something</tt>
  where <tt>something.cnb</tt> is a Cadabra notebook.
